# road
First programming project via code.org Game Lab.

A game where you jump over cars with your spacebar heading to you at a progressively fast velocity.
Your character and game atmosphere change as you attain more points and are bewildered in embarrassment for falling below zero points.

If you want to play it, create a [Code](https://code.org) account, make a new project with Game Lab and paste [this code here](https://github.com/JustinKolaras/road/blob/main/index.js).

I made this when I was 11.
